      <description>After the launch of the native/mobile web applications, we had to build the desktop experience on Ember.js. Prior to this, every LinkedIn product was its own separate project. Some were server-side rendered, some used Backbone-Marionette, some used a custom built JS framework. Now, all LinkedIn consumer products were to be within the same Ember.js application, served as a single page app.
Since we had a mobile-web application, the strategy was to &amp;ldquo;extend&amp;rdquo; this for the desktop application.</description>
