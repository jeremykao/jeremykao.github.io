      <description>I&#39;ve worked on quite a few projects here since November 2018. Back then, we had no paying customers yet, but now we&#39;ve got a couple, and I have a lot more coworkers (yay!). I won&#39;t really go into details, but you can find more information on our website: https://www.abnormalsecurity.com. Or you can contact me if you&#39;d like to know more.</description>
