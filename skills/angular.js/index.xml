      <description>As a summer intern for Intuit&#39;s TurboTax in San Diego, I was tasked with helping build out the new support website. This project was particularly interesting because some members on my team were migrating a bunch of the old app to the cloud, and I was building a new app with Angular.js.
I learned quite a bit of Angular 1.0, which I thought was AWESOME, until I got to $scopes. Very soon, Angular 1.</description>
