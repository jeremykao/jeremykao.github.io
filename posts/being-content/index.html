        <p>Recently, I was helping my friend assess what a good compensation package was for an early stage startup. My friend hadn't really had any startup experience, and I joined an early stage startup a few years back, so I guess I was qualified to judge how good the compensation package was. I said it was &ldquo;pretty reasonable&rdquo;, but my friend also talked to a few other folks. They all collectively said that it's &ldquo;a bit low&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This entire conversation was pretty eye-opening for me. I definitely learned a few things about myself.</p>
<ol>
<li>My perspective of what good compensation looks like in my industry is out of date. It's mind boggling hearing how much people are making and contrasting that to what I make.</li>
<li>I'm probably not getting compensated as well as I could be. The market is honestly nuts.</li>
<li>If I had stayed at my old job, I think my financial situation would probably be better. Time will tell about this one, but just from rough calculations, I probably would be making 2-3x. That means I essentially could retire twice as fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all of this comparing and constrasting and feeling like I should be optimizing the returns from my time spent doing something, the major thought running through my head at the end of this was &ldquo;oh well&rdquo;. And that honestly felt pretty good. I felt what it feels like to be content.</p>
<p>My past self would probably be somewhat angry or stressed about not making the most use of my time, but my current self feels okay. I'm at a point in my life where my actions are not really driven by money. I've come to the realization that there are a lot of more important things in my life than money. I know I'm not optimizing my financial situation, and I feel perfectly fine not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>How did this come to be? I'm not really sure. I think it's just me and my travels lately, talking to people across all walks of life. Or it's me attempting to figure out where and how I want to live and putting some offers on some houses that could've been my home for the next 5-10 years.  Whatever it is, it's new to me <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>To be clear, one of the reasons why I feel this way is because my financial situation is already pretty good I feel. I am privileged to not have to really worry too much about anything financial related. I might not be able to buy a super nice house in the most expensive real estate market, but I don't have to worry about the day-to-day spending. I have more than enough to be comfortable. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
