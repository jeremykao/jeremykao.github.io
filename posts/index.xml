      <description>Hello!
Thanks for stumbling upon my blog. The last time I blogged was probably a solid 5 years ago, so it&#39;s definitely been a while. The content was insignificant back then, so you can probably expect the same. Jkjk&amp;hellip; I hope not.
The inspiration for me to suddenly start blogging again is that I&#39;ve been keeping a trello around where I write my thoughts/learnings about some cool articles I stumble upon and want to save for later.</description>
