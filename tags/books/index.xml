      <description>I recently listened to this audiobook called The Nordic Theory of Everything. This book highlighted various differences between the American lifestyle and the Finnish (or any Nordic country) lifestyle. Having lived in both Finland and the US as an adult, the author is able to describe firsthand how governmental policies, education, outlooks on life affected her and her peers when living in the two countries.
A major principle of what the author calls The Nordic Theory of Love is the idea that the strongest relationships are ones that are free from dependencies.</description>
