      <description>I feel like COVID-19 has made me a bit more introspective. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m mostly alone with my thoughts for most of the day. Perhaps it&#39;s because everyone is adjusting to this global pandemic, and this is just my reaction to a new way of life. Whatever the reason, I&#39;ve decided to acknowledge it and see if I could express my feelings and thoughts better.
Today was an interesting day for me emotionally.</description>
