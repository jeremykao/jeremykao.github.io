      <description>Recently, I was helping my friend assess what a good compensation package was for an early stage startup. My friend hadn&#39;t really had any startup experience, and I joined an early stage startup a few years back, so I guess I was qualified to judge how good the compensation package was. I said it was &amp;ldquo;pretty reasonable&amp;rdquo;, but my friend also talked to a few other folks. They all collectively said that it&#39;s &amp;ldquo;a bit low&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I feel like COVID-19 has made me a bit more introspective. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m mostly alone with my thoughts for most of the day. Perhaps it&#39;s because everyone is adjusting to this global pandemic, and this is just my reaction to a new way of life. Whatever the reason, I&#39;ve decided to acknowledge it and see if I could express my feelings and thoughts better.
Today was an interesting day for me emotionally.</description>
