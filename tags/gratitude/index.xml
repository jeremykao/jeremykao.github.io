      <description>One of the things that the pandemic has brought to my life is a lot more routineness. Each week that passes by feels similar to the previous one, and suddenly, it&#39;s July! Where did half of 2020 go? As someone who always felt like he had to be doing something, the everyday ritual of waking up, working long hours, playing animal crossing, rinse and repeat took a bit of a toll on me.</description>

      <description>I feel like COVID-19 has made me a bit more introspective. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m mostly alone with my thoughts for most of the day. Perhaps it&#39;s because everyone is adjusting to this global pandemic, and this is just my reaction to a new way of life. Whatever the reason, I&#39;ve decided to acknowledge it and see if I could express my feelings and thoughts better.
Today was an interesting day for me emotionally.</description>
