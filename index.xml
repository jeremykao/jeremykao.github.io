      <title>On Goal Setting and Why it Ain&#39;t it</title>

      <description>As with many folks who&#39;ve been stuck in the house for the past few months, I&#39;ve been a lot more attentive to my feelings. Deep down, I know I&#39;m dissatisfied with some things in my life, but it&#39;s been extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly what I need to change.
So I&#39;ve been analyzing and reflecting on my past, thinking about moments that brought me joy, specific events that made me anxious, specific annoyances at work, etc.</description>

      <title>A Feeling I Can&#39;t Shake</title>

      <description>I have almost everything anyone could ask for, but my emotions and mental state don&#39;t reflect that. Why?
 That&#39;s the question that&#39;s been killing me for the past couple of months.
The past few months have thrown me a ton of curveballs. I moved out of San Francisco and back into my parents place. On one hand, it&#39;s been awesome to chill with them and my sister. On the other hand, my days have become more and more routine.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Reminder that you are not a Failure</title>

      <description>One of the things that the pandemic has brought to my life is a lot more routineness. Each week that passes by feels similar to the previous one, and suddenly, it&#39;s July! Where did half of 2020 go? As someone who always felt like he had to be doing something, the everyday ritual of waking up, working long hours, playing animal crossing, rinse and repeat took a bit of a toll on me.</description>

      <title>Book of Isaiah II</title>

      <description>I stumbled upon a fantastic, inspirational documentary on Isaiah Thomas and his life as an NBA player so far.
Context For those who don&#39;t know who Isaiah Thomas is: he is a 5&#39;9 guard who&#39;s claim to fame was leading the Boston Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016. He put up incredible numbers (29 points and 6 assists on only 33 minutes per game) during his time there and pretty much carried the team.</description>

      <title>Today&#39;s Special is Excitement, Disappointment, and Relief Served with a Side of Gratitude</title>

      <description>I feel like COVID-19 has made me a bit more introspective. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m mostly alone with my thoughts for most of the day. Perhaps it&#39;s because everyone is adjusting to this global pandemic, and this is just my reaction to a new way of life. Whatever the reason, I&#39;ve decided to acknowledge it and see if I could express my feelings and thoughts better.
Today was an interesting day for me emotionally.</description>

      <description>Hello!
Thanks for stumbling upon my blog. The last time I blogged was probably a solid 5 years ago, so it&#39;s definitely been a while. The content was insignificant back then, so you can probably expect the same. Jkjk&amp;hellip; I hope not.
The inspiration for me to suddenly start blogging again is that I&#39;ve been keeping a trello around where I write my thoughts/learnings about some cool articles I stumble upon and want to save for later.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve worked on quite a few projects here since November 2018. Back then, we had no paying customers yet, but now we&#39;ve got a couple, and I have a lot more coworkers (yay!). I won&#39;t really go into details, but you can find more information on our website: https://www.abnormalsecurity.com. Or you can contact me if you&#39;d like to know more.</description>

      <title>Various Desktop Feed Features</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20180101-li-desktop-features/</link>

      <guid>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20180101-li-desktop-features/</guid>
      <description>I worked on the Desktop feed for quite a while. Performance, i18n, and accessiblity were always a work-in-progress for a product that receives millions of views a day across the world in 20+ languages/locales.
Here are some of the interesting projects I worked on:
New way of rendering feed updates Developer velocity was also a focus for a period of time. Now that we had the feed served across 4 platforms (android, ios, mobile-web, desktop), it was always a huge effort to create a new feed update.</description>

      <title>Deprecating the old Desktop Feed and a 13&#43; year old monorepo</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20170101-li-deprecate-hp/</link>

      <guid>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20170101-li-deprecate-hp/</guid>
      <description>With the launch of the new Desktop experience, efforts to remove the old desktop were put in place. Due to the slow ramp of the desktop experience (performance in various countries/markets was a challenge), the old desktop feed still lived around while most folks used the new desktop experience.
Eventually though, it came time to deprecate this service, so I worked a lot on analyzing traffic to make sure nothing was redirecting to the old homepage.</description>

      <title>New Desktop LinkedIn Feed w/ Ember.js</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20160801-li-desktop/</link>

      <guid>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20160801-li-desktop/</guid>
      <description>After the launch of the native/mobile web applications, we had to build the desktop experience on Ember.js. Prior to this, every LinkedIn product was its own separate project. Some were server-side rendered, some used Backbone-Marionette, some used a custom built JS framework. Now, all LinkedIn consumer products were to be within the same Ember.js application, served as a single page app.
Since we had a mobile-web application, the strategy was to &amp;ldquo;extend&amp;rdquo; this for the desktop application.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Messaging on Mobile-Web</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20160501-li-mobile-web/</link>

      <guid>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20160501-li-mobile-web/</guid>
      <description>During my time maintaining the LinkedIn Desktop feed, I was &amp;ldquo;loaned&amp;rdquo; to the Messaging team to help build the new messaging experience on mobile web. I joined 2 other folks to help work on this product (Sponsored InMail, Share as Message from Feed, etc.).
This was a fast-paced environment, and I learned a lot about Ember 2.0. Developing for mobile-web was also quite interesting for me because performance is limited (network latency, slower cpu) and layout is a lot more variable (lots more variation in screen sizes) than desktop.</description>

      <title>Threaded Likes/Comments on Desktop LinkedIn Feed</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20150801-li-spindle/</link>

      <guid>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20150801-li-spindle/</guid>
      <description>While I was maintaining Linkedin&#39;s desktop feed experience, I also helped add threaded likes and comments to the desktop feed. Other folks were adding it to the new native Android/iOS applications and the new mobile-web experience.
Threaded likes and comments allowed users to like a comment and comment on a comment and surfaced various new updates related to those actions.
This was a fun project because it required a lot of thought into making a comment more like an update, which itself was already complex due to its recursive nature (updates can contain other updates when someone likes/comments/reshares an update).</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Feed/Homepage Maintainence</title>

      <description>Starting mid 2015, LinkedIn embarked on an ambitious project to rewrite a good portion of their consumer experiences. The previous Mobile experience relied a bit on webviews backed by a nodejs service, so the Android and iOS apps were both rewritten in the platform native languages: Swift and Java. There was also not a good mobile-web application, so a mobile-web Ember.js application was also written.
On a team of 3 Frontend developers for Feed, 2 worked on this new mobile-web experience, while I handled maintaining the desktop LinkedIn feed experience.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Messaging Prototype</title>
      <link>https://jeremykao.com/projects/20140701-li-msg/</link>

      <description>Prior to 2015, LinkedIn had an email-like messaging system, where each message received was its own distinct item in the inbox.
There was a new initiative to change this to be threaded, more like a chat system. As part of my intern project, I worked on writing a new web application that would support this. This was also one of the first experiments of Ember.js at LinkedIn.
This project was initially written in Backbone.</description>

      <title>TurboTax Support Site</title>

      <description>As a summer intern for Intuit&#39;s TurboTax in San Diego, I was tasked with helping build out the new support website. This project was particularly interesting because some members on my team were migrating a bunch of the old app to the cloud, and I was building a new app with Angular.js.
I learned quite a bit of Angular 1.0, which I thought was AWESOME, until I got to $scopes. Very soon, Angular 1.</description>

      <description>Hey! Thanks for visiting my personal website.
I&#39;m a full stack web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. My area of expertise is building web applications. Although I can work up and down the stack, UI/UX/Product is where I prefer to spend most of my time.
I eventually want to start a business and perhaps own a restaurant or bakery.
In my free time, you can usually find me exploring nature, learning something new, expressing myself via some art form, or cooking a delicious meal.</description>

      <description>Overview I&#39;m fortunate enough to be in a position where I don&#39;t really have to worry about any major financial or health issues. This allows me to direct some of time, energy, and finances to causes I care about. I always enjoy hearing what other folks are passionate about, so I figured I&#39;ll share some of mine. Perhaps that&#39;ll spark some interest in you, give you some new knowledge, or inspire you to share yours.</description>
